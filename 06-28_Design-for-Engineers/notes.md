# Design for Engineers

## Interactive Design

* Respect design  (not as controllable so we hate it)
* two information processing, comp and brain
* great interface: self describing, preventing errors, speed 
* self describing: consistency, affordances (implied physics), natural mapping,
direct manulipation, metaphor (abstract consistency)
* errors: avoid modes, prevent data loss, have undo
* visual heirchacry
* fitts law
* hicks law

## Visual Design

* people are smart, they just don't care
* best design sometimes invisible
* invisible order (gestalt)
* io: line stuff up, even on different screens
* io: design the spaces
* io: what does it mean?
* show me that you care, show people you care about your product
* do things that not necessarily useful but shows you care
